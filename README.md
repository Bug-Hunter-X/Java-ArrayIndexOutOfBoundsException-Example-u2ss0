This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The program attempts to access an array element at an index that is out of bounds.  The solution demonstrates how to handle this exception using a try-catch block. This is a common error encountered when working with arrays in Java and understanding how to handle it properly is important for writing robust code.
